## 👋 About Me

**Frontend Developer Supervisor at Halmahera Sukses Mineral** — leading and mentoring the frontend team while building fast, scalable web applications using **React** and **Next.js**.

Previously, I worked as a **Senior Frontend Developer at Maybank**, where I mentored engineers, improved performance across critical systems, and delivered enterprise-grade web and mobile-web apps within Agile environments.

I hold a **B.Ed from Universitas Negeri Semarang** and am a proud graduate of **Glints Academy by Binar Bootcamp**.

I’m passionate about **clean code**, **great user experience**, and helping developers grow in their careers.

Currently based in **Indonesia**, and always open to interesting conversations!
